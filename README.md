# üß† Brain Tumor Identification and Segmentation using MRI Images

This project focuses on identifying and segmenting **brain tumors from MRI scans** using **image processing** and **machine learning techniques**.  
By combining **Bilateral Filtering**, **Binary Thresholding**, **K-Means Clustering**, and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, this model accurately detects and highlights tumor regions, providing a reliable tool for early diagnosis and research assistance.

## üß© Abstract
Brain tumors occur due to the abnormal growth of cells in the brain, and their progression can lead to brain cancer.  
Medical imaging techniques such as **CT scans**, **X-rays**, and **MRI** are used for tumor detection, among which **MRI** is considered the most reliable due to its ability to detect even minute structural abnormalities.

In this project:
- **Bilateral Filtering (BF)** is used for noise removal and image enhancement.
- **Binary Thresholding** and **K-Means Clustering** are used for tumor segmentation.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** assists in reliable detection and prediction of tumor regions.

The model aims to automatically predict whether the subject has a tumor or not, reducing dependency on manual diagnosis and increasing the accuracy of detection.

## üí° Introduction
According to **The International Association of Cancer Registration (IARC)**, over **28,000** brain tumor cases are reported in India each year, with more than **24,000** deaths annually due to lack of pre-diagnosis.

**Brain Tumor Segmentation** involves distinguishing tumor tissue from normal brain tissue in MRI scans.  
This project helps doctors and researchers visualize and identify tumor regions efficiently using image segmentation techniques.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Existing Methods
Earlier approaches used **pre-trained deep learning models** such as:
- VGG-16  
- VGG-19  
- Inception V3  
- MobileNet V2  

While effective, these models require large datasets and computational resources.  
They also may not generalize well for all MRI formats or low-quality images.

We used Convolutional Neural Network to predict whether the subject has Brain Tumor or not from MRI Images. Methods that could be used to increase accuracy includes, using large no. of images i.e., a larger dataset, Hyperparameter Tuning, Using a different Convolutional Neural Network Model may also result in higher accuracy.
